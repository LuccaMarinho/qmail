.SH NAME
fixsmtpio \- filter SMTP I/O and exit status
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fixsmtpio
.I prog
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fixsmtpio
is an SMTP proxy.
It synchronously and transparently wraps
.BR ofmipd ,
.BR qmail-smtpd ,
or any other SMTP server designed to run from
.BR tcpserver .
.B fixsmtpio
can be configured to adjust certain
client requests,
server responses,
and exit codes,
most commonly to continue authenticated SMTP sessions started by
.BR authup .

With no configuration,
.B fixsmtpio
changes no observable behavior.
If you observe otherwise, please report the bug.

The
.B "EXIT CODES"
section is especially important for this program.
.SH "EXIT CODES"
.B authup
expects
.B fixsmtpio
to exit 18
when
.I control/fixsmtpio
exists and fails to parse.
.B fixsmtpio
does so.

.B authup
expects distinct exit codes for distinct conditions.
.B checkpassword
exits 1 when a password is unacceptable.
.B ofmipd
and
.B qmail-smtpd
exit 1 when any error occurs.
.B fixsmtpio
can and should be configured to exit
.TP 3
14
when the server greeting code starts with 4 (temporary failure),
.TP 3
15
when the server greeting code starts with 5 (permanent failure),
.TP 3
16
when the server times out,
and
.TP 3
0
when the server receives EOF from the client.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.B authup
sets
.B AUTHUP_USER
in the environment.
Typical filter rules apply if and only if this variable is present.
.SH "FILTER RULES"
Filter rules follow the format:

.I [env]:event:[request-prepend]:response-line-glob:[exitcode]:[response]

(Values other than
.I response
may not contain ":", the field separator.)
.TP 5
.I env
.br
(optional)
Environment variable which must be present for the rule to apply.
If empty, none is required.
.TP 5
.I event
.br
(required)
SMTP verb (or "clienteof", "greeting", or "timeout") to which the rule applies.
This field is matched case-insensitively.
.TP 5
.I request-prepend
.br
(optional)
String to prepend to the request before passing it to the server.
"NOOP " (with trailing space) causes the server to trivially accept a request,
performing no action.
If empty, the request is sent as is.
.TP 5
.I response-line-glob
.br
(required)
.BR fnmatch(3) -style
glob pattern, with no special options set.
The rule applies to each matching line of the server response.
.TP 5
.I exitcode
.br
(optional)
Numeric code with which
.B fixsmtpio
is to immediately exit.
If empty, it exits when it normally would.
If no rules override it,
.B fixsmtpio
exits with the same code as its child
.IR prog .
.TP 5
.I response
.br
(optional)
String that replaces every matching line of the server response.
If empty, matching lines are removed.

Special case:
"&fixsmtpio_noop"
causes the response to be sent as is.

Special case:
"&fixsmtpio_fixup"
computes the replacement string via an event-specific internal routine.
(If no corresponding routine exists,
.B fixsmtpio
will refuse to run.)
Routines exist for
.TP 10
.BR HELP :
.br
Prepend this program's home page,
in an attempt to direct support requests to
.BR AUTHOR .
Please enable it!
.TP 10
.BR "greeting",
.BR EHLO ,
.BR HELO ,
and
.BR QUIT :
.br
Include
.I smtpgreeting
in the response.
This is harmless with
.BR qmail-smtpd ,
which already does so,
and updates
.BR ofmipd 's
behavior to match.
.TP 0
Rules are applied in the order written. For instance, if two rules
match, the later rule modifies the response returned by the
earlier rule.
If multiple matching rules for an event set
.BR exitcode ,
the last one wins.

Not all rules (alone or in combination) make practical sense.
An earlier rule can cause a later one to start (or stop) matching.
Keep your configuration as simple as possible, and test it well.
See
.BR EXAMPLES .
.SH "CONTROL FILES"
.TP 5
.I fixsmtpio
Filter rules as described in
.BR "FILTER RULES" .
Default: none.
.TP 5
.I smtpgreeting
SMTP greeting message.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise
.B fixsmtpio
will refuse to run.
The first word of
.I smtpgreeting
should be the current host's name.
